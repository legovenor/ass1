Thank you very much. Total amount needed is $200 ($100 x 2 denomination) and I need you to scratch the back of the card to reveal the pin, then take a snapshot of the back showing the pin with the receipt and send them to my email so I can forward it to her once I have it. If you want to buy in-store, here are the retailers that sell Apple gift cards in a variety of denominations.

Walgreens.
Target.
Kroger
CVS Pharmacy.
7 Eleven.
Best Buy.

Once again thanks.

Thank you so much , the amount I promised to send her is £200 (£100 x 2 denomination). I already tried online myself but its seems not to be working after you get the online card. You can purchase it from any shop or supermarkets around you, shops like Asda, Waitrose, Mccolls, WHsmith, Morrisons, Sainsburys, Coop, Clinton cards e.t.c. She needs it to purchase something online today and I promised to do anything for her today. No need to post it, I need you to remove the card from its pack, you will see the claim codes starting with letter X at the back of the card, then take a snapshot of the back showing the codes and have them attached to me or you can easily write out the pins and send them to me so I can forward it to her.

I owe you a lot.

Glad to hear from you. I really need to get an (Apple gift card) for a friend daughter who is a cancer patient. I promised her as a birthday gift but I cannot do this right now because due to the throat pain caused by laryngitis. I tried purchasing it online but unfortunately all efforts were to no avail. Wondering if you could get it from any store around you ? I'll pay back asap.

Kindly let me know if you can handle this.

Thanks

It's great to hear from you. I'm in urgent need of an Apple gift card for a friend's daughter who is battling cancer. I had promised it to her as a birthday gift, but I'm unable to do so at the moment due to the throat pain caused by laryngitis. I tried purchasing it online, but unfortunately, my attempts were unsuccessful. I was wondering if you could help me out by getting it from a nearby store. I'll reimburse you as soon as possible. Please inform me if you are able to assist with this. Thank you.

I'm really struggling to communicate because of this intense throat pain from laryngitis. Additionally, I've been facing obstacles in answering phone calls.


I am currently experiencing great difficulty in speaking as a result of a severe throat pain caused by a debilitating condition known as laryngitis. This condition has greatly affected my ability to communicate effectively, making it incredibly challenging for me to engage in conversations over the phone. The pain and discomfort I am experiencing in my throat have made it nearly impossible for me to articulate my words with clarity and precision. As a result, I find myself struggling to answer incoming calls, further exacerbating my frustration and hindering my daily activities.



Many Thanks,

She received the card, She was very happy. You need to see her email but kids will always be kids. She is really holding me to my promise because I told her I will do anything for her on her Birthday. She just emailed me that the card weren't enough to complete what she had to do with it . Please can you render me one more favour and I promise to pay back as soon as possible! I need you to help me purchase another Apple gift card for £200 so she could complete what she has to use it with.  I owe you £300, please let me know how you want to receive your money.

I really do appreciate it

I am at the hospital and won't be available to receive the gift card, please can you take your time to get it done or just write out the codes.

Thank you so much, I promised to send her an Apple gift card for £100. You can buy the gift card to my email so I can forward it to her once it arrives.

I owe you a lot

I'll be glad to get the gift card to her today.
